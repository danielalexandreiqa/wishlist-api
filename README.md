# Wishlist API

API for the simple Wishlist app made with [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org/)!

You can try it [here](https://wishlist-quasar.netlify.com).

You can find the app/front-end [here](https://github.com/yokiharo/wishlist).

Feel free to contribute!

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/yokiharo/wishlist-api.git` in a folder of your choice;
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` on the created project folder to install pre-requisites;
3. Create a *.env* file with your own secrets so they are caught on `process.env.SECRET` (don't forget to add this file to .gitignore!);
4. Run `npm run start` to start developing;
5. Make your changes and create a PR :smiley:

## Disclaimer
This app's only purpose is educational - We made it for fun mostly as a way of learning and training [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org/). The app is provided to you *as is*, considering it is an open-source project and may change over time. The app **DOES NOT** store any information from you except in the case of signing in, in which case we store your list items along with your OAuth provider's ID, e.g. Google ID, so you can retrieve them later. The information is stored on a free tier cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). In case of offline use instead of signing in, the app only stores information locally in your browser, using [Quasar Web Storage (LocalStorage)](https://quasar-framework.org/components/web-storage.html).

We're still learning and as such it's only natural to make mistakes. Let us know if there's something that should be corrected or could be done better. All feedback is welcome!
